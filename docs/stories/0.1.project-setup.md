## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Technology Stack**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.3]
- Frontend: Next.js (Single Page Application)
- Backend/DB: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, File Storage, Real-time Service)
- Hosting/DevOps: Vercel

**System Design**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.1]
- Single Page Application (SPA) with unified frontend
- Two distinct experiences: public portal (/) and admin dashboard (/admin)
- Routing-based experience management
- Maximizes code reuse and ensures brand consistency

### Technical Implementation Details
**Design System**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- tokens.json file must be created from Design System Profile
- Convert tokens to global CSS variables
- Use tokens for all component styling to ensure visual consistency

**Asset Management**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- Static assets stored in /public/images/ directory
- Use Next.js <Image> component for optimized rendering
- Include: logo, background images (organizer-dashboard-bg.jpg)

### Design System Profile
**Key Design Tokens**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- Primary accent: #E85E2C (hover: #D05528)
- Text colors: light #FFFFFF, dark #2D2D2D
- Font family: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Border radius: 8px standard

### Project Structure Requirements
**File Organization**:
- /public/images/ for static assets
- Global CSS variables for design tokens
- Unified app structure supporting both public and admin routes

### Service Integration
**Supabase Services**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.2]
- PostgreSQL Database for data storage
- Authentication service for admin access
- File Storage for document uploads
- Real-time Service for live updates

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for utility functions and components
- Integration tests for Supabase connectivity
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Design system token validation tests

### Test File Structure
- __tests__/ directory for unit tests
- cypress/ directory for e2e tests
- Test files co-located with components where applicable
