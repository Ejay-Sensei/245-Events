## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Technology Stack**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.3]
- Frontend: Next.js (Single Page Application)
- Backend/DB: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, File Storage, Real-time Service)
- Hosting/DevOps: Vercel

**System Design**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.1]
- Single Page Application (SPA) with unified frontend
- Two distinct experiences: public portal (/) and admin dashboard (/admin)
- Routing-based experience management
- Maximizes code reuse and ensures brand consistency

### Technical Implementation Details
**Design System**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- tokens.json file must be created from Design System Profile
- Convert tokens to global CSS variables
- Use tokens for all component styling to ensure visual consistency

**Asset Management**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- Static assets stored in /public/images/ directory
- Use Next.js <Image> component for optimized rendering
- Include: logo, background images (organizer-dashboard-bg.jpg)

### Design System Profile
**Key Design Tokens**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- Primary accent: #E85E2C (hover: #D05528)
- Text colors: light #FFFFFF, dark #2D2D2D
- Font family: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Border radius: 8px standard

### Project Structure Requirements
**File Organization**:
- /public/images/ for static assets
- Global CSS variables for design tokens
- Unified app structure supporting both public and admin routes

### Service Integration
**Supabase Services**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.2]
- PostgreSQL Database for data storage
- Authentication service for admin access
- File Storage for document uploads
- Real-time Service for live updates

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for utility functions and components
- Integration tests for Supabase connectivity
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Design system token validation tests

### Test File Structure
- __tests__/ directory for unit tests
- cypress/ directory for e2e tests
- Test files co-located with components where applicable

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: James DEV Agent - Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References

**Issue 1: Stagewise Package Not Found**
- **Problem**: `npm install stagewise --save-dev` failed with 404 error
- **Status**: Package not found in npm registry
- **Impact**: Cannot complete Task 4 (Development Tooling Setup)
- **Next Steps**: Need clarification on correct package name or installation method

### Completion Notes List

**✅ Completed Autonomous Tasks:**
1. **Source Control**: Git repository initialized, branching strategy established, .gitignore created, initial commit made
2. **Next.js Setup**: Full application scaffolded with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and App Router
3. **Supabase Client**: JavaScript client installed and configured with TypeScript types
4. **Design System**: Complete tokens.json file created, CSS variables implemented, Inter font configured
5. **Asset Management**: All project assets moved to public/images/ directory structure
6. **Environment Templates**: Comprehensive environment documentation created with variable templates

**⚠️ Pending External Dependencies:**
1. **Supabase Project**: Requires external account creation and project setup
2. **Vercel Deployment**: Requires external account and project configuration
3. **Stagewise Tool**: Package not found in npm registry - needs clarification
4. **Environment Variables**: Actual credentials needed to replace placeholders

**🎯 Ready for Next Phase:**
- Core technical foundation is complete and functional
- Next.js application runs successfully (CSS compilation error fixed)
- Design system fully integrated with CSS variables
- Project structure follows architecture specifications
- Ready for external service configuration
