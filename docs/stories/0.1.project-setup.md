## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Technology Stack**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.3]
- Frontend: Next.js (Single Page Application)
- Backend/DB: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, File Storage, Real-time Service)
- Hosting/DevOps: Vercel

**System Design**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.1]
- Single Page Application (SPA) with unified frontend
- Two distinct experiences: public portal (/) and admin dashboard (/admin)
- Routing-based experience management
- Maximizes code reuse and ensures brand consistency

### Technical Implementation Details
**Design System**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- tokens.json file must be created from Design System Profile
- Convert tokens to global CSS variables
- Use tokens for all component styling to ensure visual consistency

**Asset Management**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- Static assets stored in /public/images/ directory
- Use Next.js <Image> component for optimized rendering
- Include: logo, background images (organizer-dashboard-bg.jpg)

### Design System Profile
**Key Design Tokens**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- Primary accent: #E85E2C (hover: #D05528)
- Text colors: light #FFFFFF, dark #2D2D2D
- Font family: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Border radius: 8px standard

### Project Structure Requirements
**File Organization**:
- /public/images/ for static assets
- Global CSS variables for design tokens
- Unified app structure supporting both public and admin routes

### Service Integration
**Supabase Services**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.2]
- PostgreSQL Database for data storage
- Authentication service for admin access
- File Storage for document uploads
- Real-time Service for live updates

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for utility functions and components
- Integration tests for Supabase connectivity
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Design system token validation tests

### Test File Structure
- __tests__/ directory for unit tests
- cypress/ directory for e2e tests
- Test files co-located with components where applicable

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: James DEV Agent - Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References

**Issue 1: Stagewise Package Installation - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: `npm install stagewise --save-dev` failed with 404 error (package not in npm registry)
- **Solution**: Installed from local file system at `C:\Users\ejaya\Documents\stagewise-main`
- **Command Used**: `npm install C:\Users\ejaya\Documents\stagewise-main --save-dev`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully installed and configured
- **Result**: Task 4 (Development Tooling Setup) completed

**Issue 2: CSS Compilation Error - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');` causing CSS parsing errors
- **Root Cause**: CSS import order conflict with Tailwind CSS in Next.js 15
- **Solution**: Replaced Google Fonts @import with Next.js font optimization using `next/font/google`
- **Implementation**: Updated layout.tsx to use Inter font with proper Next.js font loading
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully resolved - Application now running with HTTP 200
- **Result**: Next.js development server running without errors

### Completion Notes List

**‚úÖ Completed Autonomous Tasks:**
1. **Source Control**: Git repository initialized, branching strategy established, .gitignore created, initial commit made
2. **Next.js Setup**: Full application scaffolded with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and App Router
3. **Supabase Client**: JavaScript client installed and configured with TypeScript types
4. **Design System**: Complete tokens.json file created, CSS variables implemented, Inter font configured
5. **Asset Management**: All project assets moved to public/images/ directory structure
6. **Environment Templates**: Comprehensive environment documentation created with variable templates
7. **Stagewise Integration**: Successfully installed from local file system and configured for UI-to-AI integration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Pending External Dependencies:**
1. **Supabase Project**: Requires external account creation and project setup
2. **Vercel Deployment**: Requires external account and project configuration
3. **Environment Variables**: Actual credentials needed to replace placeholders

**üéØ Ready for Next Phase:**
- Core technical foundation is complete and fully functional
- Next.js application runs successfully (HTTP 200 - all compilation errors resolved)
- Design system fully integrated with CSS variables and Next.js font optimization
- Project structure follows architecture specifications
- Stagewise development tooling installed and ready
- Ready for external service configuration (Supabase, Vercel)
