## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 0.1 (Project Setup) has established the technical foundation including:
- Next.js application structure with App Router
- Design system tokens converted to CSS variables
- Supabase integration (not needed for this story)
- Asset management structure in `/public/images/`

### Architecture Context
**System Design**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.1]
- Single Page Application (SPA) with unified frontend
- Public portal routes use root path (/)
- Routing-based experience management

**Technology Stack**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.3]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design implementation

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - static content only.

### API Specifications
No API integration required for this story - static page implementation.

### Component Specifications
**Landing Page Component**: [Source: 245 PRD 1.1.md#1.3]
- Background: Building entrance image with slow-panning effect
- Logo: "245" brand logo prominently displayed
- Headline: "Elevate your corporate gatherings..."
- CTA: Single "Book Event" call-to-action button
- Layout: Immersive welcome page design

### File Locations
**Component Structure**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- Main component: `/src/app/page.tsx` (App Router root page)
- Static assets: `/public/images/backgrounds/hero-background.jpg`
- Styling: Use global CSS variables from design system

### Design System Implementation
**Visual Design Tokens**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- Primary accent: #E85E2C (hover: #D05528)
- Text colors: light #FFFFFF, dark #2D2D2D
- Font family: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Border radius: 8px standard

**Landing Page Specific Design**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- Background: `linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(232, 94, 44, 0.6) 0%, rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.7) 100%)`
- Background image: `organizer-dashboard-bg.jpg`
- Glass morphism cards: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` background, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` border
- Backdrop filter: `blur(10px)`

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#2.4]
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for optimized rendering
- Implement proper image loading and optimization
- Ensure responsive design across all devices

**Design System Rules**: [Source: 245 Architecture Design Document (ADD).md#3]
- DO NOT apply landing page background gradient to buttons or text elements
- DO NOT use accent colors for body text (reserved for interactive elements)

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing**:
- Unit tests for landing page component rendering
- Test CTA button click handler and navigation
- Test responsive design breakpoints

**Visual Testing**:
- Verify background image loading and positioning
- Test slow-panning animation effect
- Validate design token application

**Accessibility Testing**:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- Color contrast validation

### Project Structure Notes
File structure aligns with established Next.js App Router conventions:
- Root page component at `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Static assets properly organized in `/public/images/`
- CSS variables from design system available globally

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Component Testing**: [Source: 0.1.project-setup.md Dev Notes]
- Unit tests for components in `__tests__/` directory
- Test files co-located with components where applicable
- Use React Testing Library for component testing

**Visual Testing**:
- Verify background image renders correctly
- Test responsive design breakpoints
- Validate design system token application
- Test animation effects (slow-panning)

**Accessibility Testing**:
- Screen reader navigation
- Keyboard accessibility
- Color contrast validation
- ARIA attribute verification

### Test File Structure
- `__tests__/page.test.tsx` - Landing page component tests
- `cypress/e2e/landing-page.cy.ts` - End-to-end navigation tests
